This Minecraft Spigot plugin contains some long-term projects and is an extension to my other
plugin, [WorldUtils](https://github.com/fflopsi/worldutils).

## Installation

To install the plugin, simply place the *.jar* file in the folder *plugins* of your server. The server must run at least
Spigot, Paper is also fine (CraftBukkit does not work) **and** [WorldUtils](https://github.com/fflopsi/worldutils) must
be installed as well. On the next server (re)start, the plugin should be initialized and can be run correctly.

## Usage

To use the plugin, enter an appropriate command. All commands have tab completion, so you do not need to know the exact
syntax when typing.

The commands and their respective syntax are:

- `/allitems start | skip | reset`

For further information on how this all works in detail and more,
